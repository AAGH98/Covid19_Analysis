# Introduction

Coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 is the source of the extremely contagious respiratory disease known as COVID-19. When the virus was first discovered in Wuhan, China, towards the end of 2019, it quickly spread over the world and began to infect millions of individuals. Senior citizens and those with existing medical disorders are more susceptible to serious illnesses or fatalities from COVID-19, which can cause symptoms ranging from minor respiratory problems to severe pneumonia.

When discussing COVID-19, death rates relate to the percentage of confirmed cases that end in fatalities. Comprehending the mortality rates is essential for evaluating the gravity of the illness, directing public health measures, and putting plans in place to lessen the virus's effects. The effectiveness and accessibility of healthcare, population health in general, and demographics all have an impact on death rates. Analysing and tracking death rates is essential to directing international efforts to control and contain the COVID-19 epidemic.
